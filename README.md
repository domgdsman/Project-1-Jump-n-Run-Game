Ironhack Full Stack Web Dev Course first Project: Building a game with JavaScript in five days

Raptor Rockets is my first project as part of the Ironhack Full Stack Web Development program. The task was to develop a game
in Javascript in only five days.

I decided to go for an arcade like "Jump & Run" type of game, where you have to collect items and dodge incoming rockets
while navigating obstacles. I used p5.js with the p5.play and p5.sound libraries as well as sprites and other free image
resources I found online.

In the current state, the game has a playable area of 1200x800px x20 while drawing a random obstacle preset every 1200x800px
of the canvas (this is adjustable by increasing the Times_PLAYINGFIELD multiplier in the constants, but you might experience
performance issues at some point).

I hope you enjoy the game :)

CheersðŸ˜Ž

PS: Try to beat my current high-score: 490 pts!ðŸ˜‰\
If you like a challenge, try setting rocket.speed to 15 and spawn rockets in the game.draw() every 20 frames!
